\chapter*{Abstract}

This paper proposes a speed camera algorithm using Raspberry Pi and computer vision. The algorithm utilizes image alignment with feature detection, object detection with optical flow, and speed calculation with a pinhole camera to detect and calculate the speed of vehicles. The methodology includes a detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and the hardware and software used in the implementation.

The results obtained from the implementation show high accuracy and effectiveness in detecting and calculating vehicle speed. We compare the result of the proposed algorithm with the value obtained experimentally and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm and suggest further improvements and research. The practical applications and significance of the proposed algorithm are also discussed.
