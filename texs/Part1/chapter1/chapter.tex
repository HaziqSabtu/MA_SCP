\chapter{Methodic Product Development}

\dots some text on comparison of other methods such as hanser and rodenacker \dots

In this research, the methodic product development process by Pahl and Beitz \cite{pahl2007engineering} is utilized. The methodic product development process is a systematic approach to product development. At the core of this methodology is the systematic progression through various stages, each with its own defined objectives and activities. These stages include problem definition, conceptual design, embodiment design, detail design, and finally, the testing and evaluation of the product.
