\chapter{Embodiment Design}
The next phase in the design methodology is embodiment design. This phase, as defined by Pahl and Beitz \cite{Pahl07t}, involves starting with the fundamental solution or concept for a technical product and then advancing the design in alignment with technical and economic criteria, taking into account further information. The ultimate objective is to reach a stage where the subsequent detailed design can smoothly progress into the production phase.
Figure \ref{fig:embodiment_design} shows the steps involved in this phase.

\end{figure}

\section{Basic Rules of Embodiment Design}
When it comes to product design, there are some basic rules that must be followed. As defined by Pahl and Beitz \cite{Pahl07v}, they include clarity, simplicity, and safety. Neglecting these rules can potentially result in issues and accidents. Subsequent sections will provide a comprehensive exploration of these guidelines.

\subsection{Clarity}
Clarity, as described by Pahl and Beitz \cite{Pahl07w}, entails establishing clear and unambiguous connections within a design. This involves ensuring straightforward relationships between subfunctions, inputs, and outputs to prevent any confusion or misinterpretation. It also extends to the selection of a working principle, where designers should choose principles that clarify cause-and-effect dynamics, align with the product's purpose, and optimize its layout by eliminating unnecessary complexity.

Additionally, clarity applies to the broader design structure, whether it involves multiple working principles or component combinations. It mandates that the design facilitates the orderly flow of energy, materials, and signals, preventing adverse effects like excessive forces or wear. This commitment to clarity ultimately enhances the product's reliability and durability.

\subsection{Simplicity}
Simplicity \cite{Pahl07x} in design is epitomized by an uncomplicated and easily comprehensible approach, often achievable by using fewer components. Such simplicity can lead to cost savings, reduced wear and tear, and minimized maintenance requirements. Nonetheless, it's crucial to strike a balance, as certain functions inherently demand a minimum number of components.

Designers should, therefore, strive for a minimalist approach by employing the fewest components possible while maintaining straightforward shapes, as this promotes efficiency and practicality in the design process. The choice between numerous components with simple shapes, albeit potentially increasing production effort, and a single, more affordable cast component should be made while considering the specific problem and constraints.

\subsection{Safety}
Safety \cite{Pahl07y} considerations are crucial in ensuring both the effective performance of technical functions and the protection of people and the environment. Designers rely on a safety methodology outlined in the German industry standard DIN 31 000, which encompasses three levels: direct safety, indirect safety, and warnings. In general, designers should prioritize direct safety measures, seeking solutions that inherently eliminate potential dangers. Only when this is not feasible should they resort to indirect safety measures, involving the construction of specialized protective systems.

Warnings, which serve to highlight dangers and hazard zones, are best utilized in conjunction with direct and indirect safety measures, clarifying specific risks. As designers address technical challenges, they encounter various constraints, not all of which can be simultaneously overcome. However, their objective remains to develop solutions that come as close as possible to meeting all requirements. It's important to note that exceptionally high safety demands can complicate design, potentially diminishing clarity and economic viability, and even leading to project abandonment in some cases.

\section{Guideline of Embodiment Design}
In addition the the basic rules of embodiment design, Pahl and Beitz \cite{Pahl07z} also stress the importance of following a set of design guidelines to help designers meet the specific requirements and constraints. For this project, the following design guidelines are considered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Design for production
    \item Design for ergonomics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design for Production}
Design for production \cite{Pahl07aa} is a design guideline that emphasizes the importance of considering the production process during the design phase. This approach enables designers to optimize the production cost and times while ensuring the product's functionality and quality. By following the basic rules of clarity and simplicity, designers are already on the right track to achieving this goal.

\subsubsection{Appropriate Overall Layout Design}
Overall layout design, derived from the function structure, influences product division into assemblies and components, including sourcing decisions (in-house, bought-out, standard parts), production procedures, dimensions, batch sizes, joining methods, and quality control.

The layout can lead to differential, integral, composite, or building-block construction methods. Differential Construction involves breaking down components into easily produced parts, facilitating adaptability, increased component batch sizes, and easier quality assurance. However, it demands greater machining and assembly costs and may have functional limitations due to joints.

Integral Construction combines multiple parts into a single component, reducing costs due to integration but can be complex and sensitive to market conditions. Composite Construction involves connecting different parts requiring further work, applying multiple joining methods or using various materials for optimal property utilization.

Building Block Construction results from splitting components so that the parts or assemblies can be used in other products or variants, offering flexibility and cost savings. These construction methods offer specific advantages and disadvantages, depending on the context and design requirements.

\subsubsection{Appropriate Form Design of Components}
During component form design, designers significantly impact production costs, times, and product quality by choosing shapes, dimensions, surface finishes, tolerances, and fits. These choices influence production procedures, machine types, in-house vs. bought-out components, materials, and quality control procedures.

Conversely, production facilities influence design features, which may include dimension limitations necessitating component division or the acquisition of bought-out components. Many guidelines exist for appropriate component form design, and tolerances are crucial.
Figure \ref{fig:guideline} shows the design guidelines for designing components specifically for 3D printing.

    \caption{Design guidelines for 3D printing \cite{DDDimension_22}}
    \label{fig:guideline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Design for Ergonomics}
Ergonomics \cite{Pahl07ab} is vital in designing technical products, aiming to align them with human characteristics, needs, and interfaces. It covers a broad range of items, including everyday household products and human-machine interfaces. Recent focus has shifted to user-friendly interfaces and ergonomic workplace assessment tools.

Ergonomic design considers various factors, starting with biomechanics, which addresses how body postures and movements interact with product design. Physiological aspects, such as muscle action, circulation, and temperature regulation, are crucial. Sensory factors like light and noise must also be taken into account. Psychological aspects guide design to minimize cognitive load and enhance user-friendliness.

Ergonomics extends to active and passive user involvement. Active involvement necessitates careful planning, assessing if human interaction is necessary and effective. Passive involvement addresses how users are affected by products, considering factors like energy flows, vibrations, light, climate, and noise.

Identifying ergonomic requirements can follow two approaches. The object-based approach is used when designing predefined systems or products, employing checklists tailored to specific items. The effect-based approach applies to new situations, analyzing the effects of energy, material, and signal flows, ensuring they meet ergonomic requirements. Both aim to prioritize user comfort, safety, and efficiency while minimizing discomfort and errors.

    \caption{Placement of inner components}
    \label{fig:variant2_inner_components}
\end{figure}

The physical design of Solution Variant 2 follows a carefully crafted sandwich-like structure, consisting of a main body, top cover, and back cover (Figure \ref{fig:variant2_body_components}). This design choice not only ensures the protection of the internal components but also facilitates ease of assembly and maintenance. The main body serves as the central hub, housing all the essential electronics and functional elements, while the top and back covers act as protective layers, safeguarding the delicate components from potential damage due to external impacts.


A key consideration in the design is the arrangement of the inner components within the device. Following a tablet-like configuration, the main LCD is thoughtfully positioned on the front side of the main body, providing users with a clear and interactive interface (Figure \ref{fig:variant2_front_view_main}). Meanwhile, the camera, Raspberry Pi, and battery are strategically placed on the back side of the body (Figure \ref{fig:variant2_back_view_main}), optimizing the distribution of weight and ensuring a well-balanced user experience. This arrangement also enhances the device's overall usability and convenience, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{texs/Part1/chapter4/image/insert.png}
    \caption{Methods to secure components \cite{Hermann20}}
    \label{fig:insert}
\end{figure}


Ensuring the secure attachment of components to the main body is of paramount importance in the design process. Various methods for component fastening are considered, including direct attachment, threaded inserts, helicoils, side pockets, and bottom pockets as shown in Figure \ref{fig:insert}.

The simplest approach is direct attachment, where threads are designed into the 3D printed part to allow components to be screwed in. For more robust connections, threaded inserts can be used by designing holes in the 3D printed part and installing the inserts appropriately.

Helicoils offer durable threaded holes by inserting coil-shaped inserts into designed holes. Side pockets and bottom pockets involve creating cavities or slots in the 3D printed part to securely hold components. Each method offers its own set of advantages and challenges, and after careful evaluation, the variant opts for the use of threaded inserts due to their simplicity and robustness.

The battery, being a critical component within the device, requires special attention to prevent any undesirable movement or instability. Figure \ref{fig:variant2_battery_cover} shows the battery cover which will be attached to the main body, while Figure \ref{fig:variant2_battery_placement} shows the method of securing the battery to the main body.


To address this concern, an effective method for securing the battery firmly in place is implemented by utilizing a battery cover. The battery cover is then securely attached using screws and standoffs, ensuring that the battery remains in its designated position even during vigorous handling or movement.

\end{figure}


Solution Variant 2 will employ a hybrid input method, combining both touch screen and physical buttons. The touch screen will be oriented in landscape mode, while the buttons will be positioned on either side of the screen (Figure \ref{fig:variant2_front_view}). To enable the integration of the touch screen, HDMI and USB connections will be established between the touch screen and the Raspberry Pi \cite{Sunfounder}. Additionally, to facilitate the functionality of the physical buttons, they will be connected to the Raspberry Pi using its GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins \cite{Soren21}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=5 cm]{texs/Part1/chapter4/image/v29.png}

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:variant2_quick_release_plate}, we can observe the quick release plate designed to be affixed to the tripod stand. For enhanced stability during usage, Solution Variant 2 can utilize the quick release plate which can be conveniently mounted on a tripod stand.

\subsubsection{Cost Calculation}
In this section, we will perform a cost analysis for producing Solution Variant 2. It is essential to emphasize that the cost calculation for the 3D printed parts solely considers the material cost and the estimated energy consumption during the printing process. Other expenses, such as the cost of the 3D printer itself, labor, and maintenance, are not factored into the calculation. Additionally, for better comparability with other variants, the costs of the Raspberry Pi, camera module, touch screen, and battery will not be included in the calculation. The formula used to calculate the cost of the 3D printed parts is as follows:

\dots

\section{Evaluation of Preliminary Design Variants}
VDI 2225

\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}

The technical evaluation criteria are primarily derived from the list of requirements but can also be established from general conditions. The property dimensions can be captured through specific metrics as well as qualitative statements. When establishing the evaluation criteria, it must be noted that the individual goals to be evaluated are largely independent from each other. The identified criteria must be formulated positively, as this enables better alignment with the corresponding value concepts.37 The following evaluation criteria are used for the technical assessment of the various variants:

\textbf{Ergonomics:} The ergonomics of the variants are evaluated based on the following criteria: \textit{handling, weight, and dimensions}. The handling is assessed based on the ease of use and the intuitive operation of the variants. The weight is evaluated based on the weight of the variants and the weight distribution. The dimensions are assessed based on the size of the variants and the size of the individual components.

\textbf{Weight Distribution:} The weight distribution is evaluated based on the weight distribution of the variants and the weight distribution of the individual components. The value for weight distribution is retrieved from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models through detailed analysis of the device's structural layout and component placement.

\textbf{Device Weight:} Device weight evaluates the overall heaviness of the equipment. A lighter device is generally easier to handle and transport, reducing user fatigue and enabling greater mobility while maintaining performance and durability. The value for device weight is calculated from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models by summing the individual weights of all components, materials, and structural elements that constitute the device.

\textbf{Device Size:} The size criterion considers the physical dimensions of the device, assessing its compactness and portability. An optimal device size allows for convenient storage, transportation, and operation in various environments without compromising functionality. The evaluation of device size involves measuring key dimensions such as length, width, height, and any protrusions or extensions.

\textbf{Ease of Assembly:} This criterion focuses on the simplicity and efficiency of assembling and disassembling the device. A design that enables quick and hassle-free assembly and disassembly not only saves time but also enhances user convenience and reduces the risk of errors. Evaluation is conducted by assessing the number of components involved in the assembly and disassembly processes. A lower count of components often indicates a simpler and more user-friendly design. Additionally, the type and quantity of fasteners, such as screws or connectors, required for assembly are taken into account. A reduced reliance on intricate fastening mechanisms contributes to smoother handling and maintenance. By quantifying these factors, designers can gauge the ease of assembly and disassembly, enabling them to refine the design to optimize user-friendliness and operational efficiency.

\textbf{Swappable Parts:} Swappable parts assess the ease with which components or parts of the device can be interchanged or replaced. A design that facilitates swappable parts enhances flexibility, maintenance, and adaptability to different tasks or conditions. Swappable parts promote component modularity, enabling efficient repairs and upgrades. The evaluation of swappable parts is based on the number of interchangeable components and their compatibility across the device. A higher number of swappable parts indicates a design that encourages versatility and minimizes downtime during maintenance or repairs. This modularity simplifies troubleshooting and allows users to adapt the device to evolving needs or specialized requirements. By quantifying the availability of swappable parts, designers can ensure a design that empowers users to swiftly and effectively manage the device's functionality, enhancing its overall usability and lifespan.

\textbf{Durability to External Factors:} Durability to external factors evaluates how well the device can withstand exposure to various environmental conditions, such as humidity, temperature fluctuations, dust, and impacts. A high level of durability ensures a longer lifespan and consistent performance under diverse circumstances. The assessment of durability is measured by estimating the number of openings in the device. More openings can lead to greater exposure of inner components, potentially making them susceptible to external elements. Therefore, a design with fewer openings is considered more resilient, as it reduces the likelihood of environmental factors affecting critical components. By quantifying the number of openings and assessing their placement, designers can enhance the device's ability to endure harsh conditions and maintain reliable functionality over time, ultimately extending its operational life and user satisfaction.
